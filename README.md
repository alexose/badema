Bianca, Alex, and David&#39;s Excellent Mix Adventure (for Cleanweb&#39;s Boston Hackathon)

This is our entry into Cleanweb's Boston Hackathon.

Our submission is a combination of old and new web technologies.  From oldest to newest:

We set up a custom GeoServer (hosted on EC2) to supply the solar layers and calculate intersections.

We use the Sourcemap.com API to populate our supplychain data.

The frontend is based on an excellent javascript mapping library called Leaflet, which draws beautiful map tiles from MapBox.
